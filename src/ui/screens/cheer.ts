 * First the board dims and says what happened and what it was worth, in one
 * big number, for a few seconds. Then a word lands and a character dances,
 * holding on the last frame until the player taps — so the moment ends when
 * they are done with it rather than on a timer.
 *
 * The clips are optional. With `CHEER_CLIPS` empty the word carries the moment
 * on its own and holds for `WORD_ONLY_MS`, so the game never waits on an asset
 * to look right. See docs/CONTENT.md for what to hand over.

 * ones, and the later ones only exist for people who get there. Highest band
 * first: the first one the score clears is the one that plays. A band may hold
 * several clips and then it draws one at random.
 *
 * One table, because the two ladders now change at the same scores. They were
 * split while they did not, and can be split again the moment that is true —
 * but while they agree, one table is the only way they cannot drift apart.
 *
 * `at` is what the *scored* modes grade on. A mode measured by something else
 * picks a band by its position instead — see `play`'s `band` — so the words
 * and the clips stay one list however a mode decides who has earned them.
 *
 * The words can be any length: each is fitted to the screen when it is set, so
 * a long one is drawn smaller rather than running off the edges.
