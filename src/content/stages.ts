/**
 * The story: ninety-nine stages on one board size — nine by nine, eighty-one
 * blocks, the same in every mode. Every stage is dealt so that it can be
 * emptied completely, and emptying it uncovers the picture behind it.
 *
 * With the board fixed, two dials are left:
 *
 *   digitWeights  small numbers mostly → an even spread
 *                 the real one. A board dealt from loose groups leaves small
 *                 flexible numbers behind and forgives a careless line; a
 *                 level one spreads 8s and 9s about, and a 9 can only ever
 *                 pair with a 1. It sets the group sizes too — five blocks
 *                 adding to ten can only be 1s and 2s.
 *   hints 5 → 0, undos 8 → 1, splits 3 → 1
 *                 how much help there is when it goes wrong
 *
 * **Eighty-one blocks is a lot to keep clearable.** A line that takes any
 * legal move empties a 27-block board about half the time and an 81-block one
 * almost never, so on this size the forgiveness has to come from the
 * take-backs rather than from the board being small. That is why the early
 * stages carry so many. See docs/BALANCE.md.

 * a board on its big digits, because a 9 can only ever pair with a 1; at
 * twenty a 9 goes with 9+2, or 8+3, or 5+4+2. So the board is dealt with an
 * even spread of digits rather than the gentle one, which would be too easy
 * once the bigger sums are allowed.
 *
 * The board is still dealt as a union of tens, so it can always be emptied —
 * every deal has a solution using nothing but tens, and the bigger sums only
 * add ways through. What can still go wrong is the player's own line, which is
 * what the take-backs are for: five of them, enough that a mistake is
 * recoverable and few enough that they are worth spending carefully.
